/*There are four types of joins in SQL:

/*INNER JOIN: returns only the matching rows from both tables
/*LEFT JOIN: returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table
/*RIGHT JOIN: returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table
/*FULL OUTER JOIN: returns all rows from both tables, with NULL values for non-matching rows.
